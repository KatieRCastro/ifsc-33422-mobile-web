        <!--Hey Thomas!-->
        <p>
          The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity
          is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the
          message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is
          about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a
          necessarily large amount of data.
          <img
            src=".//assets/media/content-image2.jpg"
            class="img-right"
            alt="meme"
          />
        </p>
        <p class="alert">
          This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization
          and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized"
          chunks of data, as simplification usually does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a
          time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once.
          Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information
          rather than the illumination of it.
