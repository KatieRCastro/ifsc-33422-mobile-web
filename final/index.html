          The park encompasses over 95,000 acres that surround the free-flowing
          Buffalo, much of which is linked together by a growing network of
          trails to accommodate hiking and equestrian-based recreational
          activities. These trail systems also offer numerous side hikes to
          locations that showcase the natural and human history that have shaped
          the region.

          The Buffalo River flows freely for 151 miles. Typically, the paddle season begins on the upper Buffalo in the spring. More water makes this section attractive for visitors seeking a higher level of challenge with whitewater kayaking. The season moves downstream with the months, varying from month to month with rainfall. Unlike rivers that are fed by perennial springs, the Buffalo is largely rainfall dependent. In dry years, the paddling season is short and quickly moves down into the Middle and Lower Districts. In wet years, use of the upper river is prolonged with paddling opportunities spread out through the park for the entire season.

            The Buffalo River was designated as America's first national river
            in 1972. It is managed by the National Park Service as the Buffalo
            National River. The river and its surrounding ecosystem support a
            diverse array of plant and animal life, including numerous species
            of fish, birds, and mammals. It is also home to a variety of unique
            geological features, such as caves and springs. Conservation efforts
            are ongoing to protect the ecological integrity of the Buffalo River
            and its surrounding watershed. The National Park Service, along with
            various conservation organizations and local stakeholders, work to
            preserve the river's natural resources and recreational
            opportunities for future generations. Overall, the Buffalo River
            holds significant cultural, recreational, and ecological importance,
            drawing visitors from across the country to experience its pristine
            beauty and outdoor activities.
