				<h2>Antigua Guatemala</h2>
				<p>
					Nestled in the forested hills of southern Guatemala, the small city of
					Antigua was once the most prominent seat of Spanish colonial
					government between Mexico City and Lima, Peru. Founded in the early
					16th century, it served as Guatemala’s capital for almost 300 years,
					until 1773, when it was abandoned by crown officials following a
					series of devastating volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and floods. In
					the mid-1800s, agriculturists took note of Antigua’s rich volcanic
					soils, and the city thrived once again, as a center of coffee and
					grain production. It was during this period that its canary-colored
					Santa Catalina Arch, built in 1694 as a walkway for nuns, received its
					domed clock tower, becoming Antigua’s most iconic monument. In 1979,
					Unesco designated Antigua a World Heritage Site, ensuring the
					protection of its architectural and cultural legacy.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now, the city’s cobbled streets — arranged in an easy-to-navigate
					grid, with views of the imposing Volcán de Agua to the south and the
					twin peaks of Volcán de Fuego and Acatenango to the west — are lined
					with farm-to-table restaurants, contemporary art galleries and design
					studios. Beyond the city’s verdant Parque Central, these new additions
					are taking root near 17th- and 18th- century buildings in the Baroque
					Antigueño style, with decorative stucco ornamentation and low bell
					towers designed to withstand earthquakes — such as Las Capuchinas, a
					former convent that is now a colonial-era art museum. The city’s
					architectural heritage is only bested by its vibrantly patterned
					traditional textiles, made using natural dyeing techniques and sold at
					workshops and bustling open-air markets across the city. With its
					towering volcanoes (accessible by challenging day hikes), booming
					coffee scene and bevy of boutique hotels, Antigua is quickly garnering
					appeal as one of the most enticing cities in Central America.

					<h2 id="lake">Lake Atitlan</h2>
					<p>
						Located in the department of Sololá, Lake Atitlán is one of the most
						visited tourist attractions in Guatemala, and was nominated as one
						of the seven wonders of the world. It is considered to be the most
						beautiful lake in the world, and it is also conceived as one of the
						most unique places. The lake has an area of 130 km2, and the color
						of its waters varies from deep blue to green. The lake, formed
						approximately 84,000 years ago as a result of a volcanic eruption,
						is 1,500 meters above sea level, with a length of 18 kilometers, and
						a depth of up to 341 meters, making it the deepest lake in Central
						America.
					</p>
					<p>
						The hills and volcanoes around the lake offer dense forests, where
						hiking can be practiced without problems, allowing for the
						observation of a wide variety of birds, from the timid little
						woodpeckers, to the Quetzal, the National bird.
					</p>
					<p>
						The volcanoes Atitlán, Tolimán, and San Pedro (“The Three Giants“),
						on the shores of the lake, form an impressive landscape. Around the
						lake you can visit the municipalities of Santiago Atitlán, San Lucas
						Tolimán, San Antonio Palopo, Santa Catarina Palopo, Panajachel, and
						San Pedro La Laguna. Many of the inhabitants of these towns are
						descendants of the Cakchiquel and Tzutuhil groups. The villages
						offer different environments to tourists, from the peace
						characteristic of Santa Cruz la Laguna and San Pedro, popular places
						among tourists, to the festive atmosphere of Panajachel, the most
						popular spot in Sololá. You can also find all kinds of crafts such
						as fabrics, pots, chains, bracelets, drums and hammocks, among
						others. You can get to San Pedro, Santa Clara la Laguna and the rest
						of the villages by land. However, due to the number of lodging
						options in Panajachel, it is usually more convenient to get there,
						and from there, take a boat to the surrounding towns. The trip from
						Guatemala City to Lake Atitlán takes about two hours and forty
						minutes.

				<h2>Tikal</h2>
				<p>
					LorTikal, city and ceremonial centre of the ancient Maya civilization.
					The largest urban centre in the southern Maya lowlands, it stood 19
					miles (30 km) north of Lake Petén Itzá in what is now the northern
					part of the region of Petén, Guatemala, in a tropical rainforest.
					Uaxactún, a smaller Maya city, was located about 12 miles (20 km) to
					the north. The Tikal ruins are the central attraction of Tikal
					National Park, which was established in the 1950s and designated a
					UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.em ipsum dolor sit amet,

				</p>
				<p>
					Like many Maya centres of the southern lowlands, Tikal was first
					occupied as a small village in the Middle Formative Period (900–300
					BCE); subsequently, in the Late Formative Period (300 BCE–100 CE), it
					became an important ceremonial centre with the construction of major
					pyramids and temples. Its heyday, however, came in the Late Classic
					Period (600–900 CE), with the planning and construction of its great
					plazas, pyramids, and palaces, the appearance of Maya hieroglyphic
					writing and complex systems of time-counting, and the flowering of
					Maya art as seen in monumental sculpture and vase painting. The
					numerous dedicatory stelae at the site date from the 3rd century CE
					until the close of the 9th century. Such stelae, usually bearing the
					carved features of a priest or other important person, are inscribed
					with hieroglyphs and dates.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Early Classic Period (100–600 CE), Tikal was an important post
					in the great trading network that the contemporaneous central Mexican
					city of Teotihuacán had established in southern Mesoamerica. Tikal
					continued to flourish after the decline of Teotihuacán and probably
					extended its hegemony over a large part of the southern lowlands in
					the Late Classic Period. Between 600 and 800, Tikal reached its
					architectural and artistic peak, after which a decline set in, with
					depopulation and a general artistic deterioration. The last dated
					stela at the site is placed at 889. Small groups continued to live at
					the site for another century or so, but Tikal, along with the other
					Maya centres of the southern lowlands, was abandoned by the 10th
					century.

					The site’s major structures include five pyramidal temples and three
					large complexes, often called acropoles; these presumably were temples
					and palaces for the upper class. One such complex is composed of
					numerous buildings beneath which have been found richly prepared
					burial chambers. Pyramid I is topped by the Temple of the Jaguar and
					rises to 148 feet (45 metres). Just west of Pyramid I and facing it is
					Pyramid II, standing 138 feet (42 metres) above the jungle floor and
					supporting the Temple of the Masks. Pyramid III is 180 feet (55
					metres) high. Near the Plaza of the Seven Temples stands Pyramid V
					(187 feet [57 metres]). The highest of the Tikal monuments is Pyramid
					IV (213 feet [65 metres]), which is the westernmost of the major ruins
					and also the site of the Temple of the Two-Headed Serpent. Pyramid IV
					is one of the tallest pre-Columbian structures in the Western
					Hemisphere.

				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					Guatemala, officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in
					Central America. It is bordered to the north and west by Mexico, to
					the northeast by Belize, to the east by Honduras, and to the southeast
					by El Salvador. It is hydrologically bordered to the south by the
					Pacific Ocean and to the northeast by the Gulf of Honduras.
				</p>
				<p>
					Guatemala's abundance of biologically significant and unique
					ecosystems includes many endemic species and contributes to
					Mesoamerica's designation as a biodiversity hotspot. Although rich in
					export goods, around a quarter of the population (4.6 million) face
					food insecurity. Other extant major issues include poverty, crime,
					corruption, drug trafficking, and civil instability.
				</p>
				<p>
					With an estimated population of around 17.6 million, Guatemala is the
					most populous country in Central America, the 4th most populous
					country in North America and the 11th most populous country in the
					Americas. Its capital and largest city, Guatemala City, is the most
					populous city in Central America.
